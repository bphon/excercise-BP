A .gitignore file is a speical configuration file in git that specifies which files/directories that is ignored by Git when changes
are made in the repository. For example if you're working on a macOS you don't want the hidden files to be loaded onto your windows
device so it is useful for those types of things. Which ignores unnecessary information as well. To create a .gitignore file you woud
touch .gitignore, and then edit the file and add the type of files and directories you want to ignore, for example .vscode/
Then after those steps add the file and commit the changes to your repository.
